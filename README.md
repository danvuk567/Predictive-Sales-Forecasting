# Predictive-Sales-Forecasting

This is a project I found on DataQuest: [DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/power-bi-projects/). The goal is to develop a predictive sales forecasting model using historical sales data. 
Transformations were done in Power BI Power Query to clean and normalize the data into Dimension and Fact tables. Interactive visualizations were created to display various sales KPI's, 
sales revenue comparison and forecasted sales trends.
