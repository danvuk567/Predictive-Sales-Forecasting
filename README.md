## :arrow_right: **Objective** ##

This is a Power BI project I found on DataQuest with the following link: [DataQuest Power BI Sales Forecasting Project](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/power-bi-projects/#project5). The goal is to develop a predictive sales forecasting model using historical sales data. 
Transformations were done in Power BI Power Query to clean and normalize the data into Dimension and Fact tables. Interactive visualizations were created to display various sales KPI's, 
sales revenue comparison and forecasted sales trends.

## :high_brightness: **Highlights** ##

* Overall, Superstore is a profitable business with 11% profit by the end of 2020.
* Although sales revenue has increased each month in 2020 compared to prior year, October and December of 2020 have shown significant decrease in profit compared to 2019. This is more prevelant in the Central region of the US.
* California had the largest sales revenue at $0.34M. However, Texas had the 3rd largest sales revenue of $116K with the highest loss in profits of -$14K. This US state appears to have costs associated with the products sold that are higher than most states which is of great concern.
* Approximately half (48%) of the sales were to Consumers by the end of 2020.
* A large portion (43%) of the sales had COD payment method by the end of 2020.
* Sales are predicted to increase from $2.8K to around $5.3K within the next 15 days. With 95% confidence, there is a possiblity of dropping down to $1K but also possibly increasing up to $9.5K.
