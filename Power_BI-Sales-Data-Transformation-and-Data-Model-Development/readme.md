# Power BI Sales Data Transformation and Data Model Development

## Data Cleaning

The first step was to import and clean the sheet using Power Query. All columns were checked for errors, missing values, duplicates. I used the *Column quality*, *Column distribution* and *Column profile* to identify where there might be missing values, errors and possible duplicates. The Returns column had errors which were replaced with 0's. The last 2 columns *ind1* and *ind2* had null values and were removed.
