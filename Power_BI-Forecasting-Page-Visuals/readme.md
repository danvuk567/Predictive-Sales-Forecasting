# Power BI Forecasting Page Visuals

The following **Line Chart** shows the total daily sales by order date. The Power BI **Forecast** analytics feature, which uses exponential smoothing, is set up with a 15 day forecast length. There doesn't appear to be any clear seasonality in the data and sales can vary drastically from day to day so the seasonality is set to 1 day. This provide us with a simple straightforward view of daily patterns. The last day is ignored to start seeing the model at work and a 95% Confidence interval is used which provides us with a fairly reliable range of prediction.
